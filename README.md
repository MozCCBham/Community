# Welcome to the Mozilla Campus Club Birmingham!

This is the place to plan upcoming meetings and activities. We invite everyone to join us on Tuesdays 6-9 pm in the Sloaman Lounge [Computer Science (Building Y9), University of Birmingham, B15 2TT]

As we want everyone to feel welcome, read through our [Code of Conduct](https://gitlab.bham.ac.uk/MozCC-Bham/community/blob/09340c9a2bb087afc9d8d69cb57fbc294c878e53/CodeOfConduct.md)

## What are we up to?

All kinds of activities around teaching, building and protecting the web - the details are up to you, the members! We started [with a list of ideas](https://gitlab.bham.ac.uk/MozCC-Bham/community/issues?label_name%5B%5D=Lesson), so please give a thumbs up to the topics you're interested in and suggest anything that we might have missed out on, but you want to do as part of the Club.
